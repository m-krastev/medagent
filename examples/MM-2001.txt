A 78-year-old man presents to the emergency room with progressive shortness of breath over the last 2 weeks. He also complains of facial swelling over the last week and noticed that it was especially prominent this afternoon when he woke from his nap. The patient denies chest pain but does note a mild chronic cough, which has been stable for years. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his last exacerbation was 1 month ago and resolved with a course of oral glucocorticoids. The patient also had a myocardial infarction (MI) 9 years ago and underwent percutaneous angioplasty of his left anterior descending artery. Medications include a combined beta-2 agonist and anticholinergic inhaler, aspirin, rosuvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. The patient has a 60-pack-year smoking history and currently smokes half a pack per day. In the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 141/82 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. On exam, he appears slightly uncomfortable with mild use of accessory respiratory muscles. His face is shown in Figure A and distended veins are noted on his anterior chest wall. A cardiovascular exam is notable for a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, and a lung exam reveals breath sounds that are louder in the right middle lung fields. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
